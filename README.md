## Dependencies
 
The project was built with HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. This was then converted to an interactive one. 

The game is powered by a REST API at the backend to store user details which is shown in the Score Board. Ajax request are made from the API to display the Score Board, while request are sent to the backend API to store the users moves after the 16 cards have been matched.

Details stored includes:

* Name
* Number of Moves
* Date and time the game was played
